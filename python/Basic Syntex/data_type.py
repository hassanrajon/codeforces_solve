"""
python works differently, in python, if any object is refered by any 
variable, then the object is discarded

"""
x=10 #its creating an instance of integer object
x=11 # since int type is immutable, here, x is now referering to 11, their memory allocation is different,,that means x is now refering 11 ,,,its not modyfing the value of x,,,
print(x)
